Problem Statement

X Education, an online education company, generates leads from various sources such as their website, search engines, and referrals. Despite attracting a significant number of leads daily, only around 30% of these leads convert into paying customers. Once a lead is acquired (through actions such as filling out forms or referrals), the sales team engages with them through phone calls or emails. However, the low lead conversion rate presents a challenge for the company, as the sales team spends considerable time and resources on leads that do not convert. The company wants to improve this process by identifying "Hot Leads" â€“ leads that are most likely to convert.

Business Objective

The goal is to develop a logistic regression model to predict lead scores for each potential customer based on historical lead data. The lead score will range from 0 to 100, indicating the likelihood of conversion, with a higher score representing a "hot lead." By prioritizing leads with higher scores, the sales team can focus their efforts on more promising customers, thus improving the lead conversion rate. The CEO has set a target conversion rate of around 80%, aiming to significantly enhance the company's sales efficiency and reduce wasted efforts on unqualified leads.
